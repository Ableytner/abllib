"""The main module, used for dev testing"""

# TODO:
# UP NEXT
# replace all TypeError occurances with WrongTypeError

# IMPORTANT BUT ANNOYING
# add tests for threaded storage access
# document and understand levenshtein_distance
# document fuzzy score calculation
# optimize _lock_wrapper._log_callstack (takes half of the runtime when assigning storage item)

# TAKES A LOT OF TIME / NEEDED IN THE FUTURE
# add async module with function to run async func in sync context
# construct type-specific function for type checking at runtime

# pylint: skip-file

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
